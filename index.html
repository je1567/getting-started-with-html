<h1>Intro to Programming Stage 0</h1>
<b>Basics of Web</b>
<p>Computers that send requests to servers to access web pages.
The server finds the <em>HTML</em> associated with the web page based 
on the request and sends it back to the originator. 
The userâ€™s browser will then interpretthe web page 
and display on the computer. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/

interaction.  
</p>

<b>World Wide Web (www) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language></b>
<p>World Wide Web uses HTML to connect the webpages. <em>HTML</em> is the 
heart of the web, its text content, markup (how it looks), references to documents
(images and videos), and links to other web pages.
</p>

<b>Tags</b>
<p>Tags are used to create the <em>HTML</em> code. Depending on the tag, you will
have opening and/or closing tags, some tags we have used so far in module 0 are bold, emphasis, anchor, and linkable tags consisting 
both of websites or images.</a>
